        ### Initial Diagnosis / Potential Root Cause

        To help us pinpoint the problem, please answer the following questions to the best of your ability.
        Even if you're unsure, your answers provide valuable clues.

  - type: textarea
    id: initial-diagnosis
    attributes:
      label: 'Diagnostic Questions & Your Findings'
      description: |
        Consider the following common problem areas and provide your observations:
        * **Access/Connectivity:** Can you reach other services on the platform? Is it a general network issue or specific to this application?
        * **Authentication/Authorization (e.g., Keycloak):** Are you able to log in to Keycloak? Are there any error messages related to authentication? Have you tried logging in with different credentials or roles?
        * **Application Logs (e.g., Airflow):** Have you checked the logs of the affected application (e.g., Airflow pods)? Are there any error messages related to application startup, configuration, or internal errors?
        * **Platform Exposure (Ingress/Gateway):** Is the application reachable via its external URL? Have you checked if the Ingress/Gateway resource is healthy and correctly configured? Can you access the application via an internal route if available?
        * **Resource Provisioning (Crossplane):** If this application relies on a Crossplane-provisioned resource (e.g., a database, a message queue), is that resource healthy and ready according to its status in Kubernetes (e.g., `kubectl get xr <your-xr-name>`)?
        * **Dependencies:** Does the application depend on other services that might be down or misconfigured?

        - **Authentication/Authorization:** [Your findings]
